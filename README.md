# 1. Project Title
Sentiment Analysis on IMDB's reviews using Natural Language Processing with Python
 
# 2. Project Description
This project is to create a LSTM model to classify if a review is positive or negative. 

IMDB dataset that being used has 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. 
We provide a set of 35,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 15,000 for testing. 
Prediction of the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

# 3. How to Install and Run the Project
a. Code can be executed in either local environment or cloud environment such [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)<br>
b. You may try to run the deploy codes via this [link]()<br>
c. Uploads all the models file with .h5, .pkl, .json extension files as these files will be stored inside the 'model' folder as you run the training codes
